    <h1>Sweet Chili Chicken Tacos</h1>
    <p>Here's a really simple recipe I came up with when I was messing around in the kitchen. My girlfriend absolutely loves it every time I make it.</p>
    <p>It's not sophisticated in the slightest, but I think the simplicity of it really helps it in the end. Adjust according to portion size & taste.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the <em>chicken breast(s)</em> into little squares.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, coat the diced chicken in <em>corn starch</em>. Don't worry about going overboard. You want every piece to be coated.</li>

        <li>Place the coated chicken into the wok, spread evenly. Add extra olive oil.</li>

        <li>On a separate burner, heat up a flat pan to medium. Make sure the pan is fully heated. Cook tortillas, flipping once each tortilla expands, until a crust forms on both sides. Place tortillas onto their own plate for cooling.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is fully cooked, remove from burner & place cooked chicken into a clean bowl. Pour a generous amount of <em>Thai Kitchen Sweet Red Chili Sauce</em> &amp; toss, making sure every piece is coated entirely.</li>
