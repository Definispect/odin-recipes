    <h1>Lemon Loaf Recipe</h1>
    <p>This is the classic version of the <a href="https://chatelaine.com/recipe/desserts/easy-classic-lemon-loaf-recipe/">Lemon Loaf</a> recipe that once existed on <a href="chatelaine.com">Chatelaine.com</a>.</p>

    <p>It's since been replaced, but I think the original recipe (while also using <em>more easily accessible</em> ingredients) still holds up really well today!</p>
